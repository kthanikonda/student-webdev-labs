## Reflection Document

### HTML

Learning HTML is very interesting because we use so many websites in our daily lives. However, we often don't understand their functionality or how they work on the backend. With HTML, we can learn how websites are developed and what elements are used.

When it comes to the assignments, I am able to complete some of them on my own. For a few others, like JavaScript and jQuery, I used the videos in our media playlist. The exercises in this section were very helpful in reinforcing the basic structure and semantics of HTML. I feel that everything is explained in detail in both the classes and the videos, providing a hands-on experience. Everything is good, and last week's scope lecture was particularly excellent.

### Accessibility

When it comes to accessibility, I learned that it should be checked for every website. While doing the discussion assignment, I realized that not every site is good with accessibility. We used screen readers, WAVE, and for code checks, we used W3C Markup Validation, etc. I needed to use videos to complete the accessibility exercises. The exercises were very helpful, especially the one focused on making an existing webpage accessible. It explained how important it is to include small attributes like alt, headers, aria values, specificity, CSS selectors, etc.
